Soot-particles-Detection-and-AlertIOT-Based Soot Particles Detection and Alert System for Industries
Overview This project aims to monitor and detect soot and carbon particles in industrial environments using IoT sensors. The collected data is analyzed in real-time, and alerts are sent to the respective departments when pollution levels exceed predefined thresholds. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Firebase is used for real-time data management.

Project Components Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface. Firebase for backend services and real-time data synchronization. Sensors: Arduino code for collecting soot and carbon particle data. How It Works Data Collection: IoT sensors measure soot and carbon levels in the environment. Data Transmission: The sensor data is sent to Firebase in real-time. Data Visualization: The frontend application fetches and displays the real-time data. Alert System: Alerts are triggered when pollution levels exceed the predefined thresholds, notifying the relevant departments. Usage Set up Firebase: Configure your Firebase project and update the firebaseConfig.js file with your Firebase credentials. Deploy Sensors: Upload the Arduino code to your sensors and deploy them in the target environment. Run Frontend: Open index.html to view the real-time data and receive alerts.
